Purchased a few AXAGON EE35-XA3 3.5 HDD enclosures with Asmedia ASM1153E controller. One was not detected by my PC. Removed the flash (XTX XT25F01D) from a working unit.
Read the bios with TL866II-Plus programmer and replaced with the non working enclosures flash chip. After the non working one was detected by my PC I reflasd the other bios chip as well.
